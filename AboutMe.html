	<p> I wanted to prepare this site about the antakya where we made the last camp with my friends. i think , this city deserves more people to show interest here.We enjoyed it more than any other time we were in the camp.

	<p>but of course ,you must be there at least once in order to better understand the antakya , it cannot be described but only experienced :D
